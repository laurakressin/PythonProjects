# PythonProjects
My mentor and friend Kristen Womack and I are working together to learn Python to use for the manipulating and analyzing data.
We've both gotten partway through "Learning Python, the Hard Way".  Now we are starting "Data Wrangling with Python".
First lesson learned through our work?  Read all of the directions ;)
